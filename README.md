# Introduction

Like a Jedi has to build his own light-sword, a computer scientist needs to build his own computer system. This doesn't need to be in real hardware, this can perfectly be done in a simulator. Of course nobody prevents you to build a real system,
but a simulator is more flexible, much cheaper, and more fun since you can try lot's of variations.
